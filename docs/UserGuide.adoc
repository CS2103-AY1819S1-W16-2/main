== Introduction

SocialCare morphs the given AB4 application into a volunteer management system that allows Social Welfare Organisations to better manage their volunteers & events, and gain further statistical insights from the data. +

SocialCare is for organizations which *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their volunteers.* More importantly, SocialCare is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SocialCare can get your volunteer and event management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started.

Enjoy!

== Quick Start
This section contains information on how you can run SocialCare on your desktop.

To begin, follow the steps below:

.  Check you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `socialcare.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for SocialCare.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `[n/NAME]`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/charity`, `t/charity t/help` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
