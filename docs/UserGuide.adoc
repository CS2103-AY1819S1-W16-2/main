== Introduction

Non-profit organizations rely on volunteer work to maintain parts of their operations. A volunteer management system is
essential in helping to retain volunteers by ensuring that there is a large enough pool of volunteers who are motivated
to support the various events. Therefore, it is critical that a organization is able
to source the right person for the right activity.

SocialCare is an application that is designed to help your organization manage your volunteers effectively.
You will be able to:

* Manage volunteer information such as contact details.
* Manage events for your organization.
* Create volunteering records for your volunteers.

Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started.

Enjoy!
