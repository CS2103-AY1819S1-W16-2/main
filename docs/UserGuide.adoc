== Introduction

SocialCare morphs the given AB4 application into a volunteer management system that allows Social Welfare Organisations to better manage their volunteers & events, and gain further statistical insights from the data. SocialCare is for organizations which *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their volunteers *. More importantly, SocialCare is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SocialCare can get your volunteer and event management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for SocialCare.
