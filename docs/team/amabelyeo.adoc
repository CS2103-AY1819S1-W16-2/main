== PROJECT: SocialCare

---

== Overview

SocialCare morphs the given AddressBook - Level 4 application into a volunteer management system that allows Social Welfare Organisations to better manage their volunteers & events, and gain further statistical insights from the data. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

==== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all data from the application.

Format: `clear`

Example(s):

* `clear` +
Resets the application to a clean state. The panel is also updated to reflect the changes.


.Before clearing entries
image::command_clear_before.png[clear bef, 800]

.After clearing entries
image::command_clear_after.png[clear aft, 800]

The figures above shows the before and after state of clearing the entries of the application.

[[command-switch]]
==== Switching panels: `switch`

Switches the panel to display to volunteers or events +

Format: `switch -CONTEXT_ID`

****
* The application will always display the 'volunteer' panel upon startup.
* This command allows you to switch the panel between two distinct entities: 'volunteers' and 'events'.
* CONTEXT_ID for events is 'e'.
* CONTEXT_ID for volunteers is 'v'.
****

Example(s):

* `switch -e` +
Updates the panel to display the list of events.

--

The figures above show the 2 different panels. +
Application will first display the 'volunteers' panel and you can change the panel to display 'events' via the `switch` command.

=== Record Management

This section contains commands related to managing a volunteering record.


****
* The `manage` command can only be accessed after switching to the 'event' panel. (see <<command-switch>>) +
* The other commands under this section can only be accessed after executing the `manage` command.
****

==== Viewing event's volunteer records: `manage`

The panel updates to show the list of volunteers while the display area shows the volunteers currently registered for the selected event. +

Format: `manage EVENT_INDEX`

Example(s):

* `manage 1` +
View the list of volunteers assigned to event at index 1.

.Panel of events

The figure above shows the screen you will see after executing the `manage` command successfully.

The following changes are observed:

1. Panel displays the list of volunteers that you can assign to an event.
2. Name of event being managed and total number of volunteers assigned to event shown in the upper portion of the display box.
3. List of volunteers currently assigned to the event.

==== Adding volunteer to event: `add`

Adds a volunteer to the event that is currently being managed. +

Format: `add VOLUNTEER_INDEX [h/HOURS] [r/REMARKS]`

****
* VOLUNTEER_INDEX comes from the list of all volunteers shown in the panel.
* Default value for HOURS is '0'.
* Default value for REMARKS is '-'.
****

.The VOLUNTEER_INDEX

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._
|===

==== Switch command
The `switch` command is used to switch the context between 'volunteer' and 'event'.

===== Current implementation

This `switch` command requires the `SwitchCommandParser` class to parse user input and help determine the context to switch to. +

`SwitchCommandParser` implements the `Parser` class which has the `Parser#parse()` operation. This operation will throw an error if the user input does not match the command format or is an invalid context to switch to.

[NOTE]
There are only 2 valid contexts which a user can switch to with the command. +
v: 'volunteer' context +
e: 'event' context

The `switch` command updates the context found in `ModelManager` before raising the context change event to update the UI.

The figure below is the sequence diagram to show how the `switch` command works when switching from volunteer to event context.

.Simplified sequence diagram of switch command
image::command_switch_sd.png[switch SD, 800]

===== Design considerations
====== Aspect: How context is maintained
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `Context` class.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Can support even more contexts in the future due to the flexibility of a class.
|Cons| Tedious to do as relevant methods have to be implemented in model.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Pass a hard-coded context id around.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| No need to create a new object to handle the context.
|Cons| Difficult to maintain the id throughout the whole application. Any change in context id would require all the codes to be updated.
|===
+

==== Manage function

The `manage` command is used in the 'event' context to manage the volunteering records for an event. +

===== Current implementation
This `manage` command requires the `ManageCommandParser` class to parse user input and determine which event to manage. +

`ManageCommandParser` implements the `Parser` class which has the `Parser#parse()` operation. This operation will throw an error if the user input is an invalid event id.

The `manage` command updates the context found in `ModelManager` through the `model#switchToRecordContext()` function. +

In addition to updating the context, the `manage` command also does the following:

* Clear all predicates for volunteer list.
* Filter the existing records by the selected event.
* Raise a `RecordChangeEvent` to set the selected event.
* Raise a `ContextChangeEvent` to update the UI.

The figure below is the sequence diagram to show how the `switch` command works when switching from volunteer to event context.

.Simplified sequence diagram for manage command
image::command_manage_sd.png[manage SD, 800]

===== Design considerations
====== Aspect: Context switching
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilize `Context` class used in the `switch` function. (See <<Implementation-Switch>>)
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| No need to create a new class to change context.
|Cons| Have to create a new method in `Context` class to handle parsed user input.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Pass event and volunteer objects via `LogicManager`.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Implementation is easy.
|Cons| Classes becomes tightly coupled. The UI component would have access to methods it does not need.
|===
