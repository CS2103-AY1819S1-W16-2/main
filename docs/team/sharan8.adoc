== PROJECT: SocialCare

---

== Introduction
SocialCare is the name of a software engineering project that was undertaken as part of the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing's beginner Software Engineering module, CS2103T. More information on this module can be found https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-website/admin/index.html[here].

This document serves to document Thangavel Sharan's contributions to this software development project.

== Overview of application


SocialCare is a social welfare event and volunteer management system that runs on desktops. The user interacts with it using the CLI, and it has a GUI created using JavaFX. The application is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Key Features of SocialCare:

* Add, remove and store volunteers and events faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven application.
* Assign volunteers to events.
* Create volunteer event records detailing the event name, hours contributed and other related remarks.
* Export a PDF certificate detailing a volunteer’s involvement with the organisation (event records, contributed hours).

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to export volunteer certificates*
** _What it does_: allows the user to export a volunteer’s event records and contributed hours in the form of a PDF certificate.
** _Justification_: This feature improves the product significantly as it automates a task that is currently done largely manually, and offers the user a way to access information from outside of the application as well (via portable and printable PDF files).
** _Highlights_: This enhancement involved an in-depth analysis of available external open source libraries, and meticulous design of the exported PDF document.
** _Credits_: https://pdfbox.apache.org/team.html[Apache PDFBox], for providing the functionality to create and write to PDF files.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the total volunteer count to the status bar
