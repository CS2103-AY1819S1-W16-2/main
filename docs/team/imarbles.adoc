== PROJECT: SocialCare

:sectnums:
== Overview

This portfolio page documents my involvement in SocialCare, a project done as part of the CS21303T Software Engineering module taught in NUS.
My team decided to develop SocialCare based on our goal of wanting to _'harness the potential of software to create sustainable social change'_.

SocialCare is a desktop application made for social welfare organizations.
The application is designed to help manage volunteers and events effectively.
Users interact with the application using a Command Line Interface (CLI).
In addition, SocialCare has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display information in a user-friendly manner.

My main role as a developer for SocialCare was to implement *record management functions*, which enables users to do the following:

* View volunteers assigned to event
* Assign volunteers to event
* Update volunteering records for volunteers
* Delete volunteering records of volunteer

== Summary of Contributions
* *Major enhancement*:
added commands to *manage volunteer records*
** What it does:
The commands implemented allows the user to manage volunteering records.
They will be able to assign volunteers to events and update the number of hours contributed by the volunteer.

** Justification:
These functions are part of the core requirements for the application because we want users to be able to effectively manage volunteering records.

** Highlights:
This enhancement is completely new and required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
This enhancement was challenging as it required complete understanding of all code components so that it can be properly implemented.

* *Minor enhancement*:
added a command to allow users to *switch between panels*. The panels are used to display either volunteers or events for users to manage.

* *Code contributed*:
