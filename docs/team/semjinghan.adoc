== Overview

This portfolio documents my involvement in the SocialCare project, under the CS2103T Software Engineering module in NUS.
The main scope of the module requires students to modify an existing application with an established code base
while applying proper software engineering practices.

SocialCare is a desktop application designed to serve the volunteer and event management needs of non-profit organizations.
Users primarily interact with the application using a Command Line Interface (CLI) with elements of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display information.

My contributions to the project focused on the event management features as well as improving upon the original GUI.


== Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
